  <strong>Simplest way to manage your Design System from Cloud :)</strong>

<br/>

## Installation

- [⬇️Download](https://github.com/pratikjshah/walmart-design-system/archive/master.zip) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on the `cloud-sketch-library.sketchplugin`

## Usage

If you want to show some proper logs in the DevTools, you need to use Sketch >= 52.

You might notice performance issues when the DevTools are opened, that's because it's listening to all actions. Closing it will go back to normal.

## Notes

- Material and/or Bootstrap column layout is the most widely used standard for designs.
- This came to me because I felt that there isn't a clean solution available to do grids for layers (and I had no plans on a Weekend).
