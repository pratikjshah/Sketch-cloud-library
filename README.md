A Plugin that lets you share and collaborate your Design System with others, it includes:

> PS: I am still working on the plugin, so to onboard new Design System please reach out to me.

## Installation

## How to use "Cloud Libraries" with your current Sketch file?

Simply follow these 3 steps:

1. Install [Symbol organizer](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-organizer) and [Symbol swapper](https://github.com/sonburn/symbol-swapper)
2. Run **Symbol organizer** to arrange your current symbols and remove unused ones! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratikjshah/walmart-design-system/master/recordings/symbol-organizer.gif" />
3. Run **Symbol Swaper** to replace your local symbols with cloud library. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pratikjshah/walmart-design-system/master/recordings/sysmbol-swapper.gif" />

That's all! You are now using common cloud library.

> Please note that there might be some symbols left in your Sketch file which are not yet present in the remote library, if you wish to add them in the library kindly reach out to me.
